We’ve learned that meaningful progress only comes when the entire team makes a concerted effort. Every organization works differently, but ultimately, leaders should set measurable, data-driven goals with a strong accountability plan in place. Here are a couple of the strategies we use at Google: We try to understand how representative our own teams and partners are. For example, we aim to improve Google’s current leadership representation of underrepresented groups by 30% by 2025, and to increase representation of Black-, Latino-, and Women-owned partner creative agencies. We try to understand how accurately our marketing reflects the demographics of the region our campaign runs in. For example, in the U.S., we measure representation in our marketing against U.S. Census population benchmarks, prioritizing the groups most underrepresented in our marketing.
